Steps to run files.

(1) first run A2_P1_extract_file.ipynb file present in partA folder.
(2) once the dataset is extracted, copy the file intended for run beside extracted dataset folder and run.

Part A:
(1) file partA/A2_P1_2_best1.ipynb is test run
(2) file partA/A2_P1_2.ipynb and partA/A2_P1_2_1.ipynb is for grid and random sweep respectively.

Part B:
(1) file partB/A2_P2_2.ipynb is for bayes sweep
(2) file partB/A2_P2_2_single.ipynb is for best test accuracy

Note : I have ran all files on local machine using jupyter notebook.(with tensorflow-gpu library)
